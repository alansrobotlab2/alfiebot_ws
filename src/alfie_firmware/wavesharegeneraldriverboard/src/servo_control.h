/**
 * @brief Flushes the serial servo communication line to reset packet synchronization
 * 
 * Sends ping commands to all servos to interrupt and reset the synchronous
 * communication protocol. This is used as a recovery mechanism when servo
 * communication packets get out of sync, which can cause the control loop
 * to slow down from 8ms to 120ms with corrupted data.
 * 
 * The function iterates through all servos (NUMSERVOS) and sends individual
 * ping commands to reset the communication state.
 * 
 * @note Called automatically by updateServoStatus() when a servo fails to respond
 * @note This is a workaround solution but works effectively to maintain sync
 * @see updateServoStatus() for automatic usage context
 * @warning Adds communication overhead but necessary for protocol stability

 * @brief Updates servo status by reading current servo states via sync read
 * 
 * Performs a synchronous read operation on all servos to get their current
 * status including position, speed, load, voltage, temperature, and other
 * parameters. Updates the global mBuf array with fresh servo data.
 * 
 * The function reads 13 bytes starting from memory address 0x38 (SBS_CURRENTLOCATION), which includes:
 * - Current location (position) - 2 bytes at 0x38
 * - Current speed - 2 bytes at 0x3A
 * - Current load - 2 bytes at 0x3C
 * - Current voltage - 1 byte at 0x3E
 * - Current temperature - 1 byte at 0x3F
 * - Status flags - 1 byte at 0x40
 * - Servo status - 1 byte at 0x41
 * - Move flag - 1 byte at 0x42
 * - Additional status - 2 bytes
 * 
 * @note Called at 100Hz from the servo control loop
 * @note Blocks for serial communication duration (1-5ms depending on servo count)
 * @warning If any servo fails to respond, the function returns early and flushes the serial line
 * @see ServoLoop() for usage context
 * @see mBuf global array for where data is stored

 * 1. Iterates through all servos in mBuf array
 * 2. Builds a list of servo IDs that have torqueSwitch = 0
 * 3. Sends sync write to memory address 0x28 (SBS_TORQUEENABLE register)
 * 4. Transmits 1 byte (value 0) to disable torque on identified servos

 * 
 * The function:
 * 1. Iterates through servos with torqueSwitch = 1 (active servos)
 * 2. Extracts acceleration (1 byte) and position (2 bytes) data from mBuf memory structure
 * 3. Formats 3 bytes per servo into command buffer: [acceleration, position_low, position_high]
 * 4. Sends sync write to memory address 0x29 (register 41) with 3 bytes per servo
 * 5. Only transmits if at least one servo is active (index > 0)

 * @note Position commands automatically enable torque when sent to servo
 * @note Uses memory address 0x29 which maps to acceleration register, followed by target position
