## 📋 Overview

Alfiebot is a conversational humanoid robot built on ROS2 Humble, featuring voice interaction, LLM-powered intelligence, and expressive servo-controlled movements. The platform integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR), large language model (LLM) processing, text-to-speech (TTS), and sophisticated motor control through micro-ROS firmware.

### Key Features

- 🎤 **Voice Interaction** - Real-time speech recognition and natural language understanding
- 🧠 **LLM Integration** - Powered by modern language models for intelligent conversations
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech** - Natural voice synthesis for robot responses
- ⚙️ **Motor Control** - Servo-based articulation with Waveshare serial bus servos
- 📡 **Micro-ROS** - Efficient real-time communication with embedded firmware
- 🌐 **Network Management** - Built-in WiFi hotspot capabilities via Alfienet

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- NVIDIA Jetson device (tested on Jetson Orin series)
- ROS2 Humble
- Ubuntu 20.04/22.04

### Setup

For detailed environment setup and dependencies, see **[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)**.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alansrobotlab2/alfiebot_ws.git
cd alfiebot_ws

# Install dependencies
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

# Build the workspace
colcon build --symlink-install

# Source the workspace
source install/setup.zsh
```

### Running Alfiebot

```bash
# Launch the complete system
ros2 launch alfie_bringup alfiebot.launch.py

# Or launch individual components as needed
ros2 run alfie_asr asr_node
ros2 run alfie_llm llm_node
ros2 run alfie_tts tts_node
```

### Active Tasks

- [ ] Evaluate BEST_EFFORT vs RELIABLE QoS for core topics
- [ ] Debug message/video lag after overnight operation
- [ ] Investigate `alfie_mic` crash issue (related to reset step?)
- [ ] Benchmark Foxglove Bridge performance (on-device vs off-device)
- [ ] Fix ServoTool2 memory offset bug affecting EEPROM writes
- [ ] Add rate limiting to ServoTool slider (target: 20Hz)
- [ ] Implement min/max value constraints in ServoTool UI
- [ ] Add raw/degrees/radians unit selector to ServoTool I/O

### Modeling & Simulation

- [ ] Create simplified OnShape CAD model
- [ ] Export URDF for Foxglove Studio visualization
- [ ] Export model to NVIDIA Omniverse

### Hardware Development

- [ ] Build teleoperation rig with Teensy 4.2
- [ ] Implement "high five" gesture interaction

#### Upcoming Hardware Improvements

- [ ] Install dual antennas on head with body extensions
- [ ] Replace 6.6ft USB-C cable with 5ft version
- [ ] Upgrade shoulder bearings

#### Completed Hardware Updates ✅

- ✅ Installed smaller diameter middle wheel inserts (reduced turn jiggle)
